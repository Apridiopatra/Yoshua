1. What is the difference between IaaS, SaaS, and PaaS?

SaaS (Software as a Service) model you are provided with access to application software often referred to as "on-demand software". You don't have to worry about the installation, setup and running of the application. Service provider will do that for you. You just have to pay and use it through some client.
Examples: Google Apps, Microsoft Office 365.

PaaS (Platform as a Service), as the name suggests, provides you computing platforms which typically includes operating system, programming language execution environment, database, web server etc.
Examples: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Windows Azure, Heroku, Overview, Google App Engine, Apache Stratos.

While in IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), as the name suggests, provides you the computing infrastructure, physical or (quite often) virtual machines and other resources like virtual-machine disk image library, block and file-based storage, firewalls, load balancers, IP addresses, virtual local area networks etc.
Examples: Amazon EC2, Windows Azure, Rackspace, Google Compute Engine.



2. SaaS Platform Architecture

With this model, a single version of the application, with a single configuration is used for all customers. 
The application is installed on multiple machines to support scalability (called horizontal scaling). 
In some cases, a second version of the application is set up to offer a select group of customers with access to pre-release versions 
of the applications for testing purposes. In this traditional model, each version of the application is based on a unique code. 
Although an exception , some SaaS solutions do not use multitenancy, to cost-effectively manage a large number of customers in place.
Whether multitenancy is a necessary component for software-as-a-service is a topic of controversy.


3. SaaS (Software as a Service) Platform itecture

SaaS is a way to deliver software, the provider of the software centrally hosts one or more applications and makes them available 
to customers over the internet. SaaS is also one of the main pillars of cloud computing.  An explosion in Cloud computing, driven by 
cloud providers such as Microsoft with Azure or Amazon with AWS, has seen the growth in other products and services being delivered over 
the internet such as:

-Infrastructure as a Service
-Platform as a Service
-Machine Learning as a Service 
-...and much more!

Any updates or patches to a SaaS application are all handled by the provider.  The customer doesn’t need to download upgrades or reinstall
new versions of a product as the software is delivered over the internet.

With an explanation of SaaS out of the way, let’s look at why you might want to use this software product that’s architected like this.
